This report was generated with MNE-BIDS <span lang=\"EN-US\">(Appelhoff </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">et al.,&nbsp; </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">2019</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">).</span></span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;The dataset consists of 56 participants (comprised of 27 male and 29 female participants; comprised of 56 right hand, 0 left hand and 0 ambidextrous; ages ranged from 18.0 to 59.0 (mean = 32.66, std =11.32)). There were 56 scans in total. Recording durations ranged from 2266.0 to 2961.0 seconds (mean = 2508.55, std = 147.88), for a total of 140478.97 seconds of data recorded over all scans.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Twenty-eight medication-na&iuml;ve patients diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and twenty-eight healthy control participants completed a Go/No-Go task (Sustained Attention to Response Task; SART) embedded with thought-probes (experience sampling) to assess different attentional states, including spontaneous and deliberate mind-wandering. During the experiment, participants&rsquo; brain activity was recorded using a 64-channel EEG system. Symptom severity was additionally assessed using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">This dataset was analyzed to investigate the influence of mind-wandering on behavioral performance and cognitive processes. Reaction time, reaction time variability, and commission errors (performance measures), along with P100, P3b, and CRN ERP components (electrophysiological measures), were compared between mind-wandering and on-task episodes, as well as between ADHD and control groups, within a 20-trial window preceding each probe.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Content</h1>\n<h2>Architecture</h2>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This dataset has been formatted with MNE-BIDS </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Appelhoff&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">et al., 2019</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">) </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">and is compliant with the</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;BIDS format.

Participants were instructed to press the response button whenever a digit appeared on the screen (Go trial), except for the digit 3, which required no response (No-Go trial). They were encouraged to be quick and accurate. A total of 810 trials (720 Go trials and 90 No-Go trials) were divided into 15 blocks of either 27, 54, or 81 trials. The whole task required approximately 40 minutes per participant. At the end of each block, a thought-probe of five questions was presented on the screen. The first question asked participants about their attentional state immediately before the probe. Three response options were possible: 1) on-task (OT); 2) spontaneous mind-wandering (MW-S) and 3) deliberate mind-wandering (MW-D). The subsequent four questions inquired regarding participants' level of motivation, boredom, fatigue and task difficulty by positioning on analog scales that ranged from \"Lowest level = 0\" to \"Highest level = 100.\"&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Description of data variables</h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This table details each variable column in the <span lang=\"EN-US\"><code>sub-{subject_id}_task-sart_beh.tsv</code></span> files.</span></p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 268.687px;\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 5.71838%;\"><col style=\"width: 94.3762%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">A</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Trial number&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">B</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Trial type (1 = Go trial; 2 = No-go trial)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">C</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Stimulus displayed (numbers ranging from 1 to 9)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">D</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Reaction times (in seconds)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">E</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Response type (0 = no response; 1 = response)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">F</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Interstimulus interval (in seconds)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">G</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Response validity (0 = correct response; 1 = incorrect response [omission or commission errors])</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">H</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Auto-evaluation of attentional state (25-30 = On-task; 33-37 = deliberate mind-wandering; 40-44 = spontaneous mind-wandering)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">I</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Auto-evaluation of motivation (ranging from 0 to 100)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">J</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Auto-evaluation of boredom (ranging from 0 to 100)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">K</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Auto-evaluation of fatigue (ranging from 0 to 100)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\">L</td>\n<td style=\"height: 22.3906px;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Auto-evaluation of difficulty (ranging from 0 to 100)</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Electroencephalography</h2>\n<h3>Acquisition</h3>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The EEG was recorded with the BioSemi ActiveTwo System (Amsterdam, Netherlands) using a montage of 64 active electrodes, following the international 10-20 standard system.

The images were acquired at Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital and provided to The University of Western Australia&rsquo;s Intelligent Systems for Medicine Laboratory for analysis. The analysis was conducted using our open-source SlicerCBM software extension for the 3D Slicer medical imaging platform. The analysis steps include image processing to obtain the patient-specific brain geometry, construction of computational grids (tetrahedral grid for meshless solution of biomechanical model and regular hexahedral grid for finite element solution of the electrocorticography forward problem), biomechanics-based image warping to predict the postoperative images corresponding to the brain configuration deformed by placement of subdural electrodes, and patient-specific solution of the electrocorticography forward problem to compute the electric potential distribution within the patient&rsquo;s head. We use well-established open-source data file formats including Nearly Raw Raster Data (NRRD) files for images, STL files for surface geometry and Visualization Toolkit (VTK) files for computational grids. This facilitates the re-use of this dataset in a range of studies that rely on medical image analysis, and computational biomechanics and electrostatics to solve the electrocorticography forward problem for electrical source imaging.</p>",

    "description": "Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of electromagnetic source imaging (EMSI) in presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy.\nMethods: We prospectively recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) simultaneously with electroencephalography (EEG) and performed EMSI, comprising electric (ESI), magnetic source imaging (MSI) and analysis of combined MEG-EEG datasets (cEMSI), using two different software packages. As reference standard for irritative zone (IZ) and seizure onset zone (SOZ) we used intracranial recordings and for localization accuracy, outcome one year after operation.\nResults: We included 141 consecutive patients. EMSI showed localized epileptiform discharges (ED) in 94 patients (67%). Most of the ED-clusters (72%) were identified by both modalities, 15% only by EEG and 14% only by MEG. Agreement was substantial between inverse solutions and moderate between software packages. EMSI provided new information that changed the management plan in 34% of the patients, and these changes were useful in 80%. Depending on the method, EMSI had a concordance of 53-89% with IZ and 35%-73% with SOZ. Localization accuracy of EMSI was between 44% and 57%, which was not significantly different from MRI (49-76%) and PET (54-85%). cEMSI achieved significantly higher odds ratio compared to ESI and MSI.\nConclusions: EMSI has accuracy similar to established imaging methods and provides clinically useful, new information in 34% of the patients.\nClassification of Evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that EMSI had a concordance of 53-89% and 35%-73% (depending on analysis) for the localization of epilepsy as compared with intracranial recordings - IZ zone and SOZ respectively.",

Until now, these recordings have been carried out in post-surgical patients with externalised leads. However, a new generation of telemetric stimulators makes it possible to record and stream LFP data in chronically implanted patients. Nevertheless, whether such streaming can be combined with MEG has not been tested.</p>\n\n<p>In the present study, we tested the most commonly implanted telemetric stimulator &ndash; Medtronic Percept PC with a phantom in three different MEG systems: two cryogenic scanners (CTF and MEGIN) and an experimental Optically Pumped Magnetometry (OPM)-based system.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset and code herein make it possible to reproduce most of the figures in the paper and examine additional conditions not described in detail in the paper. The data can be useful for developing, testing and benchmarking MEG artefact removal methods.</p>",

    "description": "We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods accompanies this article.",

    "description": "Visual working memory enables us to hold onto past sensations in anticipation that these may become relevant for guiding future actions. Yet laboratory tasks have treated visual working memories in isolation from their prospective actions and have focused on the mechanisms of memory retention rather than utilization. To understand how visual memories become used for action, we linked individual memory items to particular actions and independently tracked the neural dynamics of visual and motor selection when memories became used for action. This revealed concurrent visual-motor selection, engaging appropriate visual and motor brain areas at the same time. Thus we show that items in visual working memory can invoke multiple, item-specific, action plans that can be accessed together with the visual representations that guide them, affording fast and precise memory-guided behavior.",

While the orthosis was actively moving the subject's arm, some errors were deliberately introduced for a short duration of time. During this time, the orthosis moved in the opposite direction. The errors are very simple and easy to detect. EEG and EMG data are provided. The recorded EEG data follows the BrainVision Core Data Format 1.0, consisting of a binary data file (.eeg), a header file (.vhdr), and a marker file (.vmrk) (<a href=\"https://www.brainproducts.com/support-resources/brainvision-core-data-format-1-0/%7D%7D.\">https://www.brainproducts.com/support-resources/brainvision-core-data-format-1-0/).</a> For ease of use, the data can be exported into the widely adopted BIDS format. Furthermore, for data analysis, processing, and classification, two popular options are available - MNE (Python)&nbsp;and EEGLAB (MATLAB).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>If you use our dataset, cite our paper.</strong></p>\n<p>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1304311\">10.3389/fnhum.2024.1304311</a></p>\n<p>BibTeX citation:</p>\n<div>\n<div>@ARTICLE{10.3389/fnhum.2024.1304311,</div>\n<div>AUTHOR={Kueper, Niklas and Chari, Kartik and B&uuml;tef&uuml;r, Judith and Habenicht, Julia and Rossol, Tobias and Kim, Su Kyoung and Tabie, Marc and Kirchner, Frank and Kirchner, Elsa Andrea},</div>\n<div>TITLE={EEG and EMG dataset for the detection of errors introduced by an active orthosis device},</div>\n<div>JOURNAL={Frontiers in Human Neuroscience},</div>\n<div>VOLUME={18},</div>\n<div>YEAR={2024},</div>\n<div>URL={https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1304311},</div>\n<div>DOI={10.3389/fnhum.2024.1304311},</div>\n<div>ISSN={1662-5161}</div>\n<div>}</div>\n</div>",

    "description": "When visual input has conflicting interpretations, conscious perception can alternate spontaneously between these possible interpretations. This is called bistable perception. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated the involvement of two right parietal areas in resolving perceptual ambiguity (ant-SPLr and post-SPLr). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies that selectively interfered with the normal function of these regions suggest that they play opposing roles in this type of perceptual switch. In the present study, we investigated this fractionation of parietal function by use of combined TMS with electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, while participants viewed either a bistable stimulus, a replay stimulus, or resting-state fixation, we applied single pulse TMS to either location independently while simultaneously recording EEG. Combined with participant's individual structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, this dataset allows for complex analyses of the effect of TMS on neural time series data, which may further elucidate the causal role of the parietal cortex in ambiguous perception.",

    "description": "In this series of behavioural and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, we investigate the extent to which repeating patterns of sounds capture attention. Work in the visual domain has revealed attentional capture by statistically predictable stimuli, consistent with predictive coding accounts which suggest that attention is drawn to sensory regularities. Here, stimuli comprised rapid sequences of tone pips, arranged in regular (REG) or random (RAND) patterns. EEG data demonstrate that the brain rapidly recognizes predictable patterns manifested as a rapid increase in responses to REG relative to RAND sequences. This increase is reminiscent of the increase in gain on neural responses to attended stimuli often seen in the neuroimaging literature, and thus consistent with the hypothesis that predictable sequences draw attention. To study potential attentional capture by auditory regularities, we used REG and RAND sequences in two different behavioural tasks designed to reveal effects of attentional capture by regularity. Overall, the pattern of results suggests that regularity does not capture attention.",

    "description": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using signals acquired with intracortical implants have achieved successful high-dimensional robotic device control useful for completing daily tasks. However, the substantial amount of medical and surgical expertise required to correctly implant and operate these systems greatly limits their use beyond a few clinical cases. A noninvasive counterpart requiring less intervention that can provide high-quality control would profoundly improve the integration of BCIs into the clinical and home setting. Here, we present and validate a noninvasive framework using electroencephalography (EEG) to achieve the neural control of a robotic device for continuous random target tracking. This framework addresses and improves upon both the \"brain\" and \"computer\" components by increasing, respectively, user engagement through a continuous pursuit task and associated training paradigm and the spatial resolution of noninvasive neural data through EEG source imaging. In all, our unique framework enhanced BCI learning by nearly 60% for traditional center-out tasks and by more than 500% in the more realistic continuous pursuit task. We further demonstrated an additional enhancement in BCI control of almost 10% by using online noninvasive neuroimaging. Last, this framework was deployed in a physical task, demonstrating a near-seamless transition from the control of an unconstrained virtual cursor to the real-time control of a robotic arm. Such combined advances in the quality of neural decoding and the practical utility of noninvasive robotic arm control will have major implications for the eventual development and implementation of neurorobotics by means of noninvasive BCI.",

    "description": "<p>Brain-Computer Interfaces, and especially passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (pBCI), with their ability to estimate and detect mental states, are receiving increasing attention from both the scientific and the research and development communities. Many pBCIs aim to increase the safety of complex work environments such as in the aeronautical domain. Therefore, mental workload, vigilance and decision-making are some of the most commonly examined aspects of cognition within this field of research. A large proportion of pBCIs involve a component of machine learning and signal processing as the data that are collected need to be transformed into a reliable estimate of the users&rsquo; current mental state (e.g. mental workload). Improving this component is a major challenge for researchers, requiring large quantities of data. While data sharing is common for the active BCI community, open pBCI datasets are scarcer and generally incomplete with regards to the information they report. This is particularly true for datasets encompassing several tasks or sessions, which are of importance for tackling the challenges of transfer learning. Testing new pipelines, feature extraction algorithms and classifiers are central issues for future advances in research within this domain, as well as for algorithm benchmark and research reproducibility.The COG-BCI database presented here is comprised of the recordings of 29 participants over 3 individual sessions with 4 different tasks designed to elicit different cognitive states. This results in a total of over 100 hours of open electrophysiological (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The project was validated by the local ethical committee of the University of Toulouse (CER number 2021-342). The dataset was validated on a subjective, behavioral and physiological level (i.e. cardiac and cerebral activity), to ensure its usefulness to the pBCI community. This body of work represents a large effort to promote the use of pBCIs, as well as the use of open science.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The data are in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. For more information, please read the COG-BCI_info.pdf file.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note that version 4 corrected an electrode name mismatch, for which we sincerely apologize. The answers to the RSME and KSS questionnaires are provided in two separate .txt files.</strong></p>",

In most cases, the .edf files contain exactly one hour of digitized EEG signals, although those belonging to case sub-10 are two hours long, and those belonging to cases sub-04, sub-06, sub-07, sub-09, and sub-23 are four hours long; occasionally, files in which seizures are recorded are shorter.</p><p>The EEG is recorded at 256 Hz with a 16-bit resolution.

    "description": "<p>Objective: To identify the prevalence of EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 with neurologic changes, their associated neuroimaging abnormalities and rates of mortality.</p>\n\n<p>Methods: A retrospective case series of 192 adult COVID-19 positive inpatients with EEG performed between March and June 2020 at 4 hospitals: 161 undergoing continuous, 24 routine, and 7 reduced-montage EEG. Study indication, epilepsy history, intubation status, administration of sedatives or antiseizure medications, metabolic abnormalities, neuroimaging pathology associated with epileptiform abnormalities, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed.</p>\n\n<p>Results: EEG indications included encephalopathy (54.7%), seizure (18.2%), coma (17.2%), focal deficit (5.2%), and abnormal movements (4.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities occurred in 39.6% of patients: focal intermittent epileptiform discharges in 25.0%, lateralized periodic discharges in 6.3%, and generalized periodic discharges in 19.3%. Seizures were recorded in 8 patients, 3 with status epilepticus. Antiseizure medication administration, epilepsy history, and older age were associated with epileptiform abnormalities. Only 26.3% of patients with any epileptiform abnormality, 37.5% with electrographic seizures, and 25.7% patients with clinical seizures had known epilepsy. Background findings included generalized slowing (88.5%), focal slowing (15.6%), burst suppression (3.6%), attenuation (3.1%), and normal EEG (3.1%). Neuroimaging pathology was identified in 67.1% of patients with epileptiform abnormalities, over two-thirds acute. In-hospital mortality was 39.5% for patients with epileptiform abnormalities, 36.2% for those without. Risk factors for mortality were coma and ventilator support at time of EEG.</p>\n\n<p>Significance: This article highlights the range of EEG abnormalities frequently associated with acute neuroimaging abnormalities in COVID-19. Mortality rates were high, particularly for patients in coma requiring mechanical ventilation. These findings may guide the prognosis and management of patients with COVID-19 and neurologic changes.</p>",

The inter-electrode impedances were maintained under 20 kOhm. Data were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. EEG recordings for each watermelon lasted for more than 1 hour to ensure sufficient data for the decoding task.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Citation and more information</h2>\n<p>Citation will be updated after the review period is completed.</p>\n<p>We will provide more information about this dataset (e.g. the units of the captured data) once our work is accepted. This is because our work is currently under review, and we are not allowed to disclose more information according to the relevant requirements.</p>\n<p>All metadata will be provided as a backup on Github and will be available after the review period is completed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>2 Motivation</h1>\n<p>Researchers have reported high decoding accuracy (&gt;95%) using non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding tasks like image decoding, emotion recognition, auditory spatial attention detection, epilepsy detection, etc. Since these EEG data were usually collected with well-designed paradigms in labs, the reliability and robustness of the corresponding decoding methods were doubted by some researchers, and they proposed that such decoding accuracy was overestimated due to the inherent temporal autocorrelations (TA) of EEG signals [7]&ndash;[9].</p>\n<p>However, the coupling between the stimulus-driven neural responses and the EEG temporal autocorrelations makes it difficult to confirm whether this overestimation exists in truth. Some researchers also argue that the effect of TA in EEG data on decoding is negligible and that it becomes a significant problem only under specific experimental designs in which subjects do not have enough resting time [10], [11].</p>\n<p>Due to a lack of problem formulation previous studies [7]&ndash;[9] only proposed that block-design should not be used to avoid the pitfall. However, the impact of TA could be avoided only when the trial of EEG was not further segmented into several samples. Otherwise, the overfitting or pitfall would still occur. In contrast, when the correct data splitting strategy was used (e.g. separating training and test data in time), the pitfall could also be avoided even when block-design was used.</p>\n<p>In our framework, we proposed the concept of \"domain\" to represent the EEG patterns resulting from TA and then used phantom EEG to remove stimulus-driven neural responses for verification. The results confirmed that the TA, always existing in the EEG data, added unique domain features to a continuous segment of EEG. The specific finding is that when the segment of EEG data with the same class label is split into multiple samples, the classifier will associate the sample's class label with the domain features, interfering with the learning of class-related features. This leads to an overestimation of decoding performance for test samples from the domains seen during training, and results in poor accuracy for test samples from unseen domains (as in real-world applications).</p>\n<p>Importantly, our work suggests that the key to reducing the impact of EEG TA on BCI decoding is to decouple class-related features from domain features in the actual EEG dataset. Our proposed unified framework serves as a reminder to BCI researchers of the impact of TA on their specific BCI tasks and is intended to guide them in selecting the appropriate experimental design, splitting strategy and model construction.</p>\n<h1>3 The rationality for using watermelon as the phantom head</h1>\n<p>We must point out that the \"phantom EEG\" indeed does not contain any \"EEG\" but records only noise,&nbsp;a watermelon is not a brain and does not generate any electrical signals. Therefore, the recorded electrical noises, even when amplified using equipment typically used for EEG, do not constitute EEG data when considering the definition of EEG. This is why previous researchers called it \"phantom EEG\". Some researchers may therefore think that it is questionable to use watermelon to get the phantom EEG.</p>\n<p>However, the usage of the phantom head allows researchers to evaluate the performance of neural-recording equipment and proposed algorithms without the effects of neural activity variability, artifacts, and potential ethical issues. Phantom heads used in previous studies include digital models [12]&ndash;[14], real human skulls [15]&ndash;[17], artificial physical phantoms [18]&ndash;[24] and watermelons [25]&ndash;[40]. Due to their similar conductivity to human tissue, similar size and shape to the human head, and ease of acquisition, watermelons are widely used as \"phantom heads\".</p>\n<p>Most works tried to use watermelon as a phantom head and found that the results analyzed using the neural signals from human subjects could not be obtained when using the phantom head, thus proving that the achieved results were indeed caused by neural signals. For example, Mutanen et.al [35] proposed that &ldquo;the fact that the phantom head stimulation did not evoke similar biphasic artifacts excludes the possibility that residual induced artifacts, with the current TMS-compatible EEG system, could explain these components&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Our work differs significantly from most previous works. It is firstly found in our work that the phantom EEG exhibits the effect of TA on BCI decoding even when only noise was recorded, indicating the inherent existence of TA in the EEG data. The conclusion we hope to draw is that some current works may not truly use stimulus-driven neural responses to obtain the overestimated decoding performance. Similar logic may be found in a neuroscience review article [41], they proposed that EEG recordings from phantom head (watermelon) remind us that background noise may appear as positive results without proper statistical precautions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Reference</h1>\n<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; C.

A mirror&nbsp;of this dataset is located here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gin.g-node.org/hiobeen/Mouse-threat-and-escape-Han-et-al-PNAS\">https://gin.g-node.org/hiobeen/Mouse-threat-and-escape-Han-et-al-PNAS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check this <a href=\"https://gin.g-node.org/hiobeen/Mouse-threat-and-escape-Han-et-al-PNAS/src/master/README.md\">how-to-start guide</a> to this dataset!&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. EEG dataset</p>\n\n<p>Most of all, the overall dataset structure adheres to the BIDS-EEG format introduced by Pernet et al. (2019). Within the top-level directory &#39;data_EEG-BIDS/&#39;, the EEG data is organized under paths starting with &#39;sub-##/&#39;. These EEG recordings (mouse n = 8) were recorded under the Threat-and-escape paradigm experiment, which involves dynamic interactions with a spider robot. This experiment was done in two separate conditions: the solitary condition, where a mouse was exposed to the robot alone in the arena (referred to as the &#39;Single&#39; condition), and the group condition, where mice encountered the robot alongside other conspecifics (referred to as the &#39;Group&#39; condition). This dataset only includes the data from solitary condition. CBRAIN headstage (Kim et al., 2019) was employed to record this EEG data at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. The recordings were taken from the medial prefrontal cortex (channel 1) and the basolateral amygdala (channel 2). For a comprehensive understanding of the experimental methods and procedures, please see our original publications: Han et al. (2023), Cho et al. (2023), and Kim et al. (2020).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;Position dataset</p>\n\n<p>Another top-level directory, &#39;data_behavior/&#39;, contains simultaneously recorded video (in avi format) (&#39;data_behavior/raw/&#39;) and position extracted from the video in csv format (&#39;data_behavior/processed/&#39;). The positions are located in the &#39;stimuli/position/&#39; directory.</p>\n\n<p>Position tracking is performed using the U-Net architecture of CNN (Ronnenberger, 2015; also see, Han et al. in press for detailed procedure). This method tracks the body area&#39;s location to extract its centroid.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. References</p>\n\n<p>Han, H. B., Shin, H. S., Jeong, Y., Kim, J., Choi, J.

    "description": "<p>Primates exploring and exploiting a continuous sensorimotor space rely on dynamic maps in the dorsal stream. Two complementary perspectives exist on how these maps encode rewards. Reinforcement learning models integrate rewards incrementally over time, efficiently resolving the exploration/exploitation dilemma. Working memory buffer models explain rapid plasticity of parietal maps but lack a plausible exploration/exploitation policy. The reinforcement learning model presented here unifies both accounts, enabling rapid, information-compressing map updates and efficient transition from exploration to exploitation. As predicted by our model, activity in human fronto-parietal dorsal stream regions, but not in <em>MT+</em>, tracks the number of competing options, as preferred options are selectively maintained on the map while spatiotemporally distant alternatives are compressed out. When valuable new options are uncovered, posterior beta<sub>1</sub>/alpha oscillations desynchronize within 0.4-0.7 s, consistent with option encoding by competing beta<sub>1</sub>-stabilized subpopulations. Altogether, outcomes matching locally cached reward representations rapidly update parietal maps, biasing choices toward often-sampled, rewarded options.</p>",

Also included are CS and US information, keypress responses and keypress response times for 79 healthy participants (40 males and 39 females aged 24.8+/-4.9 years). Participants underwent a classical (Pavlovian) discriminant delay fear conditioning task with 1 CS- and 2 CS+ (50% reinforcement), were reminded of one CS+ one week later under either doxycycline or placebo, and were tested in a retention/extinction and re-learning task another week later. CS were isoluminant coloured triangles. US consisted of 0.5 s square electric pulses with 0.2 ms duration and 500 Hz frequency. SOA between the CS onset and US was 3.5 s. CS and US co-terminated. Before the fear conditioning task, participants completed several questionnaires. During the retention/extinction phase, an auditory startle probe (ST) and no US was delivered 3.5 s after CS onset via headphones (102 dB, 40 ms duration with 2 ms on- and offset ramp). In an immediately following re-learning phase, the ST was omitted and the CS reinforced with the same schedule as during acquisition. The ITI was randomly determined on each trial to be 7, 9, or 11 s.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

A positive personal attitude towards ambiguity is associated with increased response in the visual cortex when presenting ambiguous stimuli. The limbic system activation highlights underlying processing in the emotional and memory domains responses in the &quot;oral&quot; domain are associated with motor and premotor activation. MNS activity has been observed during both movements&#39; execution and observation.</p>",

    "description": "Wavelet methods are widely used to decompose fMRI, EEG, or MEG signals into time series representing neurophysiological activity in fixed frequency bands. Using these time series, one can estimate frequency-band specific functional connectivity between sensors or regions of interest, and thereby construct functional brain networks that can be examined from a graph theoretic perspective. Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the choice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely undelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT vs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least Asymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24)\u2014each essential parameters in wavelet-based methods\u2014on the estimated values of graph metrics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric disease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than the DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen has a greater impact on the estimated values of graph metrics than the type of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of the method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes classification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of wavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity of these methods in estimating values of metrics drawn from graph theory. They furthermore demonstrate the importance of reporting the choices utilized in neuroimaging studies and support the utility of exploring wavelet parameters to maximize classification accuracy in the development of biomarkers of psychiatric disease and neurological disorders.",

    "description": "<p>Significance: Accurate spatial registration of probes (e.g., optodes and electrodes) for measurement of brain activity is a crucial aspect in many neuroimaging modalities. It may increase measurement precision and enable the transition from channel-based calculations to volumetric representations.</p>\n<p>Aim: This technical note evaluates the efficacy of a commercially available infrared three-dimensional (3D) scanner under actual experimental (or clinical) conditions and provides guidelines for its use.</p>\n<p>Method: We registered probe positions using an infrared 3D scanner and validated them against magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on five volunteer participants.</p>\n<p>Results: Our analysis showed that with standard cap fixation, the average Euclidean distance of probe position among subjects could reach up to 43 mm, with an average distance of 15.25 mm [standard deviation (SD) = 8.0]. By contrast, the average distance between the infrared 3D scanner and the MRI-acquired positions was 5.69 mm (SD = 1.73), while the average difference between consecutive infrared 3D scans was 3.43 mm (SD = 1.62). The inter-optode distance, which was fixed at 30 mm, was measured as 29.28 mm (SD = 1.12) on the MRI and 29.43 mm (SD = 1.96) on infrared 3D scans. Our results demonstrate the high accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed spatial registration method, making it suitable for both functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalogram studies.</p>\n<p>Conclusions: The 3D infrared scanning technique for spatial registration of probes provides economic efficiency, simplicity, practicality, repeatability, and high accuracy, with potential benefits for a range of neuroimaging applications.

    "description": "<p>A key challenge in neuroimaging remains to understand where, when and now particularly how human brain networks compute over sensory inputs to achieve behavior. To study such dynamic algorithms from mass neural signals, we recorded the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity of participants who resolved the classic XOR, OR and AND functions as overt behavioral tasks (N = 10 participants/task, N-of-1 replications). Each function requires a different computation over the same inputs to produce the task- specific behavioral outputs. In each task, we found that source-localized MEG activity progresses through four computational stages identified within individual participants: (1) initial contra-lateral representation of each visual input in occipital cortex, (2) a joint linearly combined representation of both inputs in midline occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus, followed by (3) nonlinear task-dependent input integration in temporal-parietal cortex and finally (4) behavioral response representation in post-central gyrus. We demonstrate the specific dynamics of each computation at the level of individual sources. The spatio-temporal patterns of the first two computations are similar across the three tasks; the last two computations are task specific. Our results therefore reveal where, when and how dynamic network algorithms perform different computations over the same inputs to produce different behaviors.</p>",

    "description": "Objective: To characterize the neurological phenotypes associated with COL4A1/2 mutations and to seek genotype-phenotype correlation. \nMethods We analyzed clinical, EEG and neuroimaging data of 44 new, and 55 previously reported patients with COL4A1/COL4A2 mutations. \nResults Childhood-onset focal seizures, frequently complicated by status epilepticus and resistance to anti-epileptic drugs, was the most common phenotype. EEG typically showed focal epileptiform discharges in the context of other abnormalities, including generalized sharp waves or slowing. In 46.4% of new patients with focal seizures, porencephalic cysts on brain MRI co-localized with the area of the focal epileptiform discharges. In patients with porencephalic cysts, brain MRI frequently also showed extensive white matter abnormalities, consistent with the finding of diffuse cerebral disturbance on EEG. Notably, we also identified a subgroup of patients with epilepsy as their main clinical feature, in which brain MRI showed non-specific findings, in particular periventricular leukoencephalopathy and ventricular asymmetry. Analysis of fifteen pedigrees suggested a worsening of the severity of clinical phenotype in succeeding generations, particularly when maternally inherited. Mutations associated with epilepsy were spread across COL4A1 and a clear genotype-phenotype correlation did not emerge. \nConclusions COL4A1/COL4A2 mutations typically cause a severe neurological condition and a broader spectrum of milder phenotypes, in which epilepsy is the predominant feature. Early identification of patients carrying COL4A1/COL4A2 mutations may have important clinical consequences, whilst for research efforts, omission from large-scale epilepsy sequencing studies of individuals with abnormalities on brain MRI may generate misleading estimates of the genetic contribution to the epilepsies overall.",

    "description": "<p>Elucidating the intricate relationship between the structure and function of the brain, both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has helped in the understanding of this matter, with diffusion images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and resting-state functional MRI revealing the functional connectivity (FC).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the brain operates by discrete multiscale computations in both the time and spatial domains, in a way that is far from known (Churchland and Sejnowski, The MIT Press, 1994). To advance in the understanding of this puzzle, a dual structure-function hierarchical clustering strategy was proposed in (Diez et. al, SciRep, 2015), providing a common skeleton shared by structure and function. Here, we further extend this approach by:<br>\n1. Fine-tuning the amount of matching between SC and FC via a free-parameter gamma. Specifically, when gamma&nbsp;is set to 0, SC is fully recovered, while when gamma is set to 1, FC is recovered. In between these extremes, a fusion scenario occurs, where both SC and FC contribute to the connectivity patterns.

    "description": "<div>\n<div>The EMBRACE dataset includes the multimodal dyadic recordings acquired during the final validation phase of the EMBRACE project (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101007521) using the upgraded multimodal EMBRACE system during cooperative and competitive table tennis. In particular, the dataset includes the synchronized dyadic recordings of EEG, ECG, EMG, respiration and kinematics for 36 dyads of male volunteers.</div>\n<div>The EMBRACE database was structured according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure 1.10.0 (BIDS, Introduction - Brain Imaging Data Structure 1.10.0), which is a simple and easy-to-adopt way of organizing neuroimaging and behavioral data.</div>\n<br>\n<div>Please note that due to the use of proprietary BTS .tdf files, the dataset cannot be fully BIDS compliant. Nevertheless, the structure adheres to the general BIDS principles and guidelines for organization of EEG and behavioral data.&rdquo;</div>\n<br>\n<div>In addition, &nbsp;other 2 files, with general information on the data collected during the EMBRACE multimodal acquisitions, are provided.</div>\n<br>\n<div>These additional files are:</div>\n<div>1. &nbsp;File &ldquo;participants.tsv&rdquo;: This file contains information on the volunteers included in the database. It includes the following fields:</div>\n<div>a. &nbsp;Participant ID: the unique ID code of a volunteer</div>\n<div>b. &nbsp;Dyads IDs: the unique ID code of the dyad(s) to which a volunteer contributed</div>\n<div>c. &nbsp;Session: the date on which specific dyadic acquisitions were performed &nbsp;</div>\n<div>d. &nbsp;Gender</div>\n<div>e. &nbsp;Age</div>\n<div>f. &nbsp;Note: this field specifies which EMG channels were used for the volunteer in a specific dyad, additionally providing information on the tracking of the table tennis ball</div>\n<div>g. &nbsp;Role: this field indicates whether the volunteers was subject 1 or 2 in a dyad</div>\n<div>h. &nbsp;Skill: the total skill level of the volunteer</div>\n<br>\n<div>1. &nbsp;File &ldquo;EMBRACE MULTIMODAL DATA 2025 - Participants and Dyads.xlsx&rdquo;: This file contains 2 sheets providing information on:</div>\n<div>a. &nbsp;All volunteers (Volunteer code, Month and year of birth, Dominant hand, gender, Mother tongue, Head measures (A1-A2, N-I, circumference), EEG cap size, Skill test date and outcome, Volunteer&rsquo;s age at the time of acquisitions, Acquisition date, Dyad code, Dyadic average skill level)</div>\n<div>b. &nbsp;All dyadic files (for each dyad: Dyad n., Subject 1 code and skill test score, Subject 2 code and skill test score, Dyad code, Acquisition date, EEG filename for subject 1, EEG filename for subject 2, Motion+EMG filename during solo for subject 1, Motion+EMG filename during solo for subject 2, Motion+EMG filenames for all 24 dyadic recordings).</div>\n<div>The volunteer folder</div>\n<div>Each volunteer folder, identified by the unique volunteer&rsquo;s code, includes the data acquired during 1 (or 2) dyadic multimodal acquisitions, which are organized in session folder, one for each multimodal acquisition. The name of the session folders is composed of the number of the dyad (such as D12MM, that stands for dyad n.12 made o 2 male volunteers) and the date of acquisition (such as 020425, that stands for 02/04/2025).</div>\n<br>\n<div>The following 2 folders are included in each session folder:</div>\n<div>1. &nbsp;folder &ldquo;eeg&rdquo;, which includes multichannel EEG, ECG and respiration data and the related information</div>\n<div>2. &nbsp;folder &ldquo;motion+emg&rdquo;, which includes (1) the kinematics of the coated table tennis ball and the EMG data for both subjects in the dyad during the 24 repetitions of the task conditions, and (2) the 2 solo conditions for the two subjects in the dyad (see description in section 1. &ldquo;Description of the multimodal data&rdquo; above).</div>\n<div>The &ldquo;eeg&rdquo; folder includes the following files:</div>\n<div>1. &nbsp;a &hellip;_eeg.set file, that contains the raw EEG recordings</div>\n<div>2. &nbsp;a &hellip;_eeg.json file, that contains information on the experiment (e.g., name of the project, task description, sampling frequency, etc.)</div>\n<div>3. &nbsp;a &hellip;_eeg_channel.tsv file, that contains information on the names and types of channels (e.g., eeg, ecg, respiration)</div>\n<div>4. &nbsp;a &hellip;_eeg_electrodes.tsv file, that contains information on the EEG channel layout</div>\n<div>5. &nbsp;a &hellip;_eeg_events.tsv file, that contains information on the triggers that permit to identify the various experimental conditions (e.g., solo, start cooperation easy, end cooperation hard, etc.)</div>\n<div>The &ldquo;motion&rdquo; folder includes 26 .tdf files, each of which contains 2.5 minutes of kinematic and EMG data acquired during a specific experimental condition. Twenty-four of these files refer to the repetitions of the different task conditions (i.e., 4 cooperation easy, 4 cooperation hard, 8 competition easy, 8 competition hard). The repetitions are randomized for all dyads. Files n. 25 and 26 refer to the solo condition of subject 1 and subject 2, respectively.</div>\n<br>\n<div>As an example from Figure 1, the file &ldquo;sub-BCHVNC_ses-S020425_task-pingpong_BCH1_GST2_020425_CoopHard_2.tdf&rdquo; includes the data for:</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- subject BCHVNC</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- during the dyadic acquisitions performed on 02/04/2025</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- within the dyad BCH1_GST2_020425</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- for which volunteer BCHVNC was subject 1 (see BCH1)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- during the performance of cooperative table tennis played at a hard difficulty level (CoopHard)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- second repetition of this condition (_2)</div>\n<br>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Each .tdf file includes the kinematics of the ball (which is the same for both subjects in a dyad) and the EMG files of both subjects in a dyad. In particular, the first 4 EMG files (files 1 to 4) refer to subject 1, whereas the last 4 EMG files (files 5 to 8) refer to subject 2. For each subject, the four EMG files refer to the signals acquired from the following arm muscles:</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- EMG1 and EMG5: internal biceps</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- EMG2 and EMG6: triceps</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- EMG3 and EMG7: anterior deltoid</div>\n<div>&nbsp;- EMG4 and EMG8: lateral deltoid</div>\n<br>\n<div>These data included in the .tdf files are in the proprietary format of the BTS system and can be open with BTS system.</div>\n<div>&ldquo;The .tdf files are generated by the BTS Bioengineering Smart-DX motion analysis system (https://www.btsbioengineering.com/), a proprietary system for synchronized kinematic and EMG acquisition.&rdquo;</div>\n</div>",
